# STOCKIST

An app to buy stock and track your portfolio's value.

## Approach
I really enjoyed this project and how it forced me to think about data and api design. I originally thought it would be fairly simple, but as soon as I realized the amount of overlap between transactions and portfolios, I realized I needed to reorganize my routes to make them more restful.

If I had more time, I would have like to be able to write more tests for full test coverage, implement a sell feature, so users could sell stocks as well, and create some sort of data visualization, so users could see how well their portfolio performs over time.
